#### How to determinte what Niche/Product to focus ?

start with an idea

Do KW reseach, see if it can:

* The main keyword has over 1500 local searches a month
* You think you can rank for the main key word( by looking at page one)
* a lot of long-tail keywords around the sub subject

#### How to checking your competition ?

should analyse the Page Authority , by using [Open Site explorer](http://opensiteexplorer.org/)

Metrics: You want to see multiple sites in the top 10 that have under 30 page authority. One isn’t enough, you need there to be three or more.

Note: If you see a page authority of 1, you should take the domain authority and halve it. See the screenshots and video below for more information:

#### How to Generate Contents ?

[How to write Reviews](http://www.contentchampion.com/writing-amazon-product-reviews/)

The Basic Tone of your review should be Honest and Factual.

[Review Structures](http://www.contentchampion.com/writing-amazon-product-reviews/):

Headline
Introduction to the product
Link to the product
First key feature sub-headline
First key feature paragraph about the product
Second key feature sub-headline
Second key feature paragraph about the product
A list in bullet points of the main product features and specifications
A second link to the product
Customer reviews and scores sub-headline
A paragraph stating how many customer reviews there are in Amazon for the product, and the average score they have given it.
A paragraph listing one or two of the negative points mentioned by customers in their reviews, but then pointing out the other side of the coin, so to speak, and ending on a very positive note.
A third link to the product
A conclusion, briefly summarizing the main points of your review




#### Contents Layout 

##### Seed Content

When I build a new site now, I start with around 10,000 words. 

[Home page](http://www.humanproofdesigns.com/designing-your-site-layout/): This is 2,000 words on the homepage, 

Blogroll as the home page, static front page post

**Banners** but I usually have a full-width image at the top of the page (630×420 pixels works for most themes)



Posts: 1,000 words on eight posts. This is large enough to start showing Google that you’ve got some good content and do a good job of on-page SEO.

I also have the “About”, “Privacy” and “Contact” pages, but I’m not including them in this word count.

##### Need to add at least one article per week
