#### Do you have specific themes and plugins you use on these sites? Any you care to share with us?

I've been having a lot of luck with Swift Themes. Plugins: I say Yoast SEO or Platinum SEO is a part of every blog I make. Also, I use Wordfence or similar security plugin to help cut down on hack attempts.
